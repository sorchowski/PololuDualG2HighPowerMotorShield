This module does not support additional features such as current sense or fault detection.

Pololu has a more comprehensive library for the various models in the Dual G2 High
Power Motor Shield family: https://github.com/pololu/dual-g2-high-power-motor-shield.
However, our library is simpler and does not force use of various pins.

The Makefile has options for installing the library in a typical Arduino IDE instance for Windows. Modify the WIN_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your IDE's library.
